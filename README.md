# ChessEngine

*ChessEngine* is a shared library implementing the classic game of Chess.  It could be used as a back-end for a web-based version of Chess, a desktop version, and so forth.  It's written in C++ and provides best-move recommendations based on the mini-max algorithm.  A wxWidgets-based front-end is included in the project that provides example usage of the library and testing.
